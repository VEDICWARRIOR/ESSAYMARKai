# Essay Analysis using Transformer-Based Contextual Modeling

## Overview
This project implements a Transformer-based NLP system for analyzing student reflective essays.

The system:
- Assesses semantic coherence
- Evaluates reasoning quality
- Generates structured feedback (non-generative scoring)
- Prioritizes transparency and domain generalization

## Architecture
- Pretrained BERT Encoder
- Classification Head
- Fine-tuning for domain adaptation

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
